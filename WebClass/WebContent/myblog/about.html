				<h2>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</h2>
				<p>William Shakespeare was an English poet, playwright, and
					actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English
					language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.He is often called
					England's national poet, and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works,
					including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154
					sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of
					uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every
					major living language and are performed more often than those of
					any other playwright.</p>
				<p>Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon,
					Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom
					he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith.
					Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in
					London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company
					called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men.
					He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, at age 49,
					where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's
					private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation
					about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious
					beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by
					others.</p>
				<p>Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and
					1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories, which
					are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these
					genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including
					Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the
					finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote
					tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other
					playwrights.</p>
				<p>Many of his plays were published in editions of varying
					quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, however, John
					Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of
					Shakespeare, published a more definitive text known as the First
					Folio, a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that
					included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's.
					It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is
					hailed, presciently, as "not of an age, but for all time".</p>
				<p>In the 20th and 21st centuries, his works have been
					repeatedly adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship
					and performance. His plays remain highly popular and are constantly
					studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and
					political contexts throughout the world.</p>

				<h2>HIS SAYING</h2>
				<p>Love all, trust a few. Do wrong to none.</p>
				<p>모두를 사랑하되, 몇 사람만 믿으라. 누구에게도 잘못을 저지르지 말라.</p>
				<p>How far that little candle throws his beams! So shines a good deed in a weary world.</p>
				<p>저렇게 작은 촛불이 어쩌면 이렇게 멀리까지 비쳐 올까! 험악한 세상에선 착한 행동도 꼭 저렇게 빛날 거야</p>
				<p>Glory is like a circle in the water, Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself, Till by broad spreading it disperses to naught.</p>
				<p>영광이란 수면에 퍼지는 파문과 같은 것, 점점 넓게 퍼져 사라질 때까지 계속 커지지</p>
				<p>We know what we are, but not what we may be.</p>
				<p>우리는 오늘은 이러고 있지만, 내일은 어떻게 될지 누가 알아요?</p>
				<p>Every man has business and desire, Such as it is.</p>
				<p>사람은 누구나 주어진 일과 원하는 것이 있다, 비록 보잘것없을지라도.</p>
